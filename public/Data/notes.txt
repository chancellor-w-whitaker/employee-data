Data for this report was taken from the Banner jobs function created by Michael Wooten (IT).

The jobs function was ran for the same start and end date. This was to get a static single 
day picture of what the university looked like on that particular day.

This is each distinct employee where a single job was selected in the following rank (primary, secondary, overload, etc).



** 	It's important to note that this data will not match IPEDS data. IPEDS HR is created using 
	a built in Banner process whereas this uses an in house function from IT.

----- Columns in the Dashboard -----

	Job Type -- A calculated value based primarily on JOB_ECLS_GROUP. Should only have 4 
		potential values (Faculty, Staff, Student, Unknown).
		- Administrators/Deans were delt with	in a slightly different way. 
			* Dean of Students & Dean of Libraries were moved to Staff.
			* Other Deans were moved to Faculty.
			* All others left in Administrators/Deans were moved to Staff.

	Job Group -- JOB_ECLS_GROUP from the Banner jobs function.

	Full/Part-time -- JOB_ECLS_FT_PT from the Banner jobs function.
	
	Faculty Rank -- PEAFACT_RANK_DESC from the Banner jobs function.
	
	Tenure -- TENURE_DESC from the Banner jobs function.
		This will have a flaw for prior years.
		
	Gender -- 
	
	Race -- computed_race, this is taken from a built in Banner function that I found.
		This function is used with PERIPDS process for IPEDS HR.
		It will have a flaw for prior years.

----- Jobs Function -----

This SAS Macro will call the Banner Jobs Function.

%getJobs(captureDate=&inDate, distinctEmployees='Y', pict_Codes='SM,BW,FA,ST,SS');

Banner Jobs function call.
jobs(
	P_START_DATE=>&captureDate, 
	P_END_DATE=>&endDate, 
	P_DISTINCT_EMPLOYEES=>&distinctEmployees, 
	P_PICT_CODES=>&pict_Codes, 
	P_HIGHEST_DEGREE=>'Y', 
	P_TENURE=>'Y', 
	P_RANK=>'Y', 
	P_RACE=>'Y', 
	P_APPROVER=>'Y', 
	P_ORGN_DESC=>'Y'
)

In this call endDate = captureDate.
